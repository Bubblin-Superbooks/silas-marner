It's hardly worth while to pry into young men's fooleries: it wouldn't have made any difference to you, sir, if I'd not had the bad luck to lose Wildfire. I should have paid you the money."</p><p>"Fooleries! Pshaw! it's time you'd done with fooleries.

There's my grandfather had his stables full o' horses, and kept a good house, too, and in worse times, by what I can make out; and so might I, if I hadn't four good-for-nothing fellows to hang on me like horse-leeches. I've been too good a father to you allâ€”that's what it is. But I shall pull up, sir."</p></div> </div>
