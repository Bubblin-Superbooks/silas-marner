<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Eppie, have you been a-thinking on it?"</p><p>"Only this last week, father," said Eppie, ingenuously, "since Aaron talked to me about it."</p><p>"And what did he say?" said Silas, still in the same subdued way, as if he were anxious lest he should fall into the slightest tone that was not for Eppie's good.</p><p>"He said he should like to be married, because he was a-going in four-and-twenty, and had got a deal of gardening work, now Mr. Mott's given up; and he goes twice a-week regular to Mr. Cass's, and once to Mr. Osgood's, and they're going to take him on at the Rectory."</p><p>"And who is it as he's wanting to marry?" said Silas, with rather a sad smile.</p><p>"Why, me, to be sure, daddy," said Eppie, with dimpling laughter, kissing her father's cheek; "as if he'd want to marry anybody else!"</p><p>"And you mean to have him, do you?" said Silas.</p></div> </div>
